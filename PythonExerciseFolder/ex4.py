# I made many mistakes in naming the veriables corectly and spelling misteaks.
# I learned what a veariable is and to put a "," on the end of lines to separate
# certine "prints" from eachother to place veriables in beatween to write a
# sentece.
# Also i imroved the practice of using the corect keays for the difrent
# types of code so for E.G i will press "#" normali instead of "~" wich is bound
# to the same key and activated when pressing the Shift key
